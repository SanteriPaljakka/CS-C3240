## Introduction

Space beyond our solar system has evoked curiosity for as long as we have known about its existence. Finding planets orbiting a star other than ours is the first step in the search for life outside the Earth. To shed light on these intriguing questions, NASA uses advanced data analysis and machine learning on data collected with, e.g., space telescopes.

This project uses logistic regression and deep learning methods to classify possible observations of exoplanets to false positives and data points containing information about an actual exoplanet. Section 2 introduces the data and problem statement in more detail. Section 3 presents the used machine learning methods. Section 4 displays the key results, which are then concluded in Section 5. The Python code used is given as an appendix.
